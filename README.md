## Description

  At the moment, the social media is something that we bond our lives to, for many reasons such as sharing our experiences to get interaction with other people. Because of that reason, I wanted to create an social media experience based in technology field. I've created the Tech Blog using Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars and other npm packages, so people can post what they are looking for and comment other people's posts once they are logged in to the website.
